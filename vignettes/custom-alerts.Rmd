## Submitting a NONMEM job with nmm

Instead of using bbi we can use `nmm` ([NONMEM
Monitor](https://github.com/A2-ai/nonmem-monitor/releases)) which
currently has some additional functionality of sending notifications
about zero gradients, missing -1E9 lines in ext file, and some very
basic control stream errors. Nonmem-monitor also allows for setting up
an alerter to be better fed these messages - more on that later. To use
`nmm` you can install the latest release from the github repository
linked above.

We can update the template file accordingly:

``` slurm-job-nmm.tmpl
#!/bin/bash 
#SBATCH --job-name="{{job_name}}" 
#SBATCH --nodes=1 
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task={{ncpu}} 
#SBATCH --partition={{partition}}

{{nmm_exe_path}} -c {{config_toml_path}} run
```

default, `submit_nonmem_model` will provide `nmm_exe_path` and
`config_toml_path` to the template. Just like with `bbi_exe_path`,
`nmm_exe_path` is determined with `Sys.which("nmm")` which may or may
not give you the path to the nmm binary if it is on your path or not. We
can inject the `nmm_exe_path` like we did with `bbi_exe_path` and assume
it's not on our path.

The `config.toml` file controls what `nmm` will monitor and where to
look for files and how to alert you. We'll use `generate_nmm_config()`
to create this file. First we can look at the documentation to see what
type of information we should pass to this function.
`?generate_nmm_config()`

```{r}
mod_number <- "1001"

if (file.exists(file.path(nonmem, paste0(mod_number, ".yaml")))) {
  mod <- bbr::read_model(file.path(nonmem, mod_number))
} else {
  mod <- bbr::new_model(file.path(nonmem, mod_number))
}
```

```{r}
slurmtools::generate_nmm_config(mod)
```

This generates the following toml file. By passing in just the mod
object, `nmm` will use the default values for the other options so if
you need to change which files are tracked, or how many threads to use
you'll have to explicitly pass that to `generate_nmm_config`. Since
we're in vignettes we'll need to update the `watched_dir` and
`output_dir` accordingly.

``` 1001.toml
model_number = '1001'
watched_dir = '/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/model/nonmem'
output_dir = '/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/model/nonmem/in_progress'
```

```{r}
slurmtools::generate_nmm_config( 
  mod, 
  watched_dir = "/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/vignettes/model/nonmem",
  output_dir = "/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/vignettes/model/nonmem/in_progress")
```

This updates the `1001.toml` config file to:

``` 1001.toml
model_number = '1001'
watched_dir = '/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/vignettes/model/nonmem'
output_dir = '/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/vignettes/model/nonmem/in_progress'
```

We can now run `submit_nonmem_model` and get essentially the same
behavior as running with `bbi`. On linux `~/.local/bin/` will be on your
path so saving the downloaded binaries there is a good approach.

```{r}
submission_nmm <- slurmtools::submit_nonmem_model( 
  mod, 
  overwrite = TRUE,
  slurm_job_template_path = file.path(nonmem, "slurm-job-nmm.tmpl"),
  slurm_template_opts = list(
    nmm_exe_path = normalizePath("~/.local/bin/nmm"))
)

submission_nmm
```

```{r}
slurmtools::get_slurm_jobs(user = "matthews")
```

The one difference between using `nmm` compared to `bbi` is that a new
directory is created that contains a log file that caught some issues
with our run. This file is updated as nonmem is running and monitors
gradient values, parameters that hit zero, as well as other errors from
bbi. Looking at the first few lines we can see that `bbi` was
successfully able to call nonmem. We also see an info level log that
OMEGA(2,1) has 0 value â€“ in our mod file we don't specify any omega
values off the diagonal so these are fixed at 0. Finally we see that
GRD(6) hit 0 relatively early in the run.

``` vignettes/model/nonmem/in_progress/1001/modeling_run_20240827201226.log
19:13:45 [INFO] bbi log: time="2024-09-20T19:13:45Z" level=info msg="Successfully loaded default configuration from /cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/vignettes/model/nonmem/bbi.yaml"

```

After a run has finished several messages are sent to the log after a
final check of the files listed in the `files_to_track` field of the
`1001.toml` file.

``` vignettes/model/nonmem/in_progress/1001/modeling_run_20240827201226.log
19:14:31 [INFO] Received Exit code: exit status: 0
19:14:31 [WARN] 1001.ext: Missing ext final output lines. Observed lines were: [-1000000000.0, -1000000004.0, -1000000006.0, -1000000007.0]

```

We see that GRD(6) hit zero during the run and that only a subset of the
-1E9 lines were present in the .ext file.

## Getting alerted during a run

Like we did with `bbi` and altering the slurm template file to get
notifications from [ntfy.sh](ntfy.sh) `nmm` has this feature built in!
The messages in the log file that relate to zero gradients, missing -1E9
lines, and 0 parameter values can also be sent to ntfy by altering the
`1001.toml` file. We can get these alerts in real time without having to
dig through a noisy log file.

Let's update our call to `generate_nmm_config` to have `nmm` send
notifications to the `NONMEMmonitor` topic on [ntfy.sh](ntfy.sh). Just
like how `submit_nonmem_model` can feed additional information to the
template with `slurm_template_opts`, we can add an alerter feature to
nmm with `alerter_opts`. If we go to ntfy.sh we can see that to send a
message to ntfy we can run
`curl -d "Backup successful ðŸ˜€"  ntfy.sh/mytopic`. `nmm` can call a
binary with a command and pass a message to a flag. For ntfy, the binary
is `curl` the message flag is `d` and the command is `ntfy.sh/mytopic`
and there are no additional args.

```{r}
slurmtools::generate_nmm_config( 
  mod, 
  watched_dir = "/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/vignettes/model/nonmem",
  output_dir = "/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/vignettes/model/nonmem/in_progress",
  alerter_opts = list(
    alerter = Sys.which('curl'), #binary location of curl,
    command = "ntfy.sh/NONMEMmonitor",
    message_flag = "d"
  )
)
```

This updates the `1001.toml` file to this:

``` 1001.toml
model_number = '1001'
watched_dir = '/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/vignettes/model/nonmem'
output_dir = '/cluster-data/user-homes/matthews/Packages/slurmtools/vignettes/model/nonmem/in_progress'

[alerter]
alerter = '/usr/bin/curl'
command = 'ntfy.sh/NONMEMmonitor'
message_flag = 'd'
```

When we re-run the `submit_nonmem_model` call we will now get ntfy
notifications. One thing to note is that `nmm` will print full paths in
the log, but will only send notifications with the `model_number` (or
`model_number.file_extension`).

```{r}
submission_nmm <- slurmtools::submit_nonmem_model( 
  mod, 
  overwrite = TRUE,
  slurm_job_template_path = file.path(nonmem, "slurm-job-nmm.tmpl"),
  slurm_template_opts = list(
    nmm_exe_path = normalizePath("~/.local/bin/nmm"))
)

submission_nmm
```

```{r}
slurmtools::get_slurm_jobs(user = "matthews")
```

This gives us the notifications in a much more digestible format

![nmm ntfy.sh alerts](data/images/nmm_ntfy_alerts.png)

```{r cleanup, include = FALSE}
# cancelling any running nonmem jobs
jobs <- get_slurm_jobs(user = "matthews") %>%
  dplyr::filter(job_state == "RUNNING") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(job_id)

for (job in jobs) {
  cancel_job(job)
}

unlink(file.path(nonmem, "1001"), recursive = TRUE)
unlink(file.path(nonmem, "1001.yaml"))
unlink(file.path(nonmem, "1001.toml"))
unlink(file.path(nonmem, "submission-log"), recursive = TRUE)
unlink(file.path(nonmem, "in_progress"), recursive = TRUE)
```
